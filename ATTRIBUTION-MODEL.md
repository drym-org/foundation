This document describes guiding principles and mechanisms for the process of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution (DIA).

1. DIA is intended to serve the goals of forward-looking empowerment and backward-looking fairness. That is, on the one hand, we seek to empower those entities that are likely to create value in the future, to the extent of that likely value. On the other, we seek to recognize and fairly compensate value created in the past.

2. DIA could be accomplished by the "Analyze, Appraise, Attribute" loop, that is, by analyzing a project to distill components, then appraising the proportion of value each component contributes to the whole, and finally, assigning proportion of value contributed to each component by each contributor. The aggregate proportion of value of each contributor to the project is reflected in the ATTRIBUTIONS file.

3. The standards employed in DIA should be versioned.

4. When DIA is undertaken, the outputs of the process should reference the version of the DIA standards used (i.e. a commit hash of the foundation repo). That is, the price, valuation, and attributions files should each mention the version of the foundation repo representing the standards that were used.

5. Any modifications to the attributions should be accompanied by an appended annotation to the attributions rationale file.

6. When the standards employed in DIA are modified, they should be retroactively applied ("backpropagated") to all projects that were appraised in terms of them, and any fresh outstanding balances should be paid out to eligible contributors. Any excess funds paid to contributors would be absorbed as a cost of the system as a whole.

7. Once value assignments have been recalibrated by backpropagation, the updated appraisals should propagate forward ("forward propagation") to recalibrate all dependent valuations ("backpropagation/forward-propagation wave").

8. Appraisals made of one article (such as a project or a component of a project) in terms of another should propagate fresh proportions of aggregate value to all depenencies ("Renormalization").

9. Where supply is finite, assessments of value are subject to revision in terms of demand ("pull" feedback).

10. Some assessments of value may be forgone in favor of employing macroeconomic means in cases where such analysis would be intractable. This could be done by calibrating the valuation until the desired aggregate output is achieved ("Faucet" feedback).

11. The analysis of ideas inherent in projects should be invariant to any disclosures made by project authors -- in particular, antecedent ideas are not recognized in causal terms.

12. The result of DIA should be invariant under -- and may be facilitated by -- "anonymous" translation (that is, anonymizing the data being appraised) and "illusory" translation (that is, translating the data being analyzed into an isomorphic problem (even a synthetic one) in an unrelated domain).

13. Many different procedures and analyses may be independently conducted and their results may be combined using agreed-upon procedures (which may themselves be subject to the current rule).
