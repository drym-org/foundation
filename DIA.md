1.
- Analyze the project and write down what you see as its main components at a high level
- Repeat the analysis on each component at the next level
- And repeat it again a few more times until you feel the components are reasonably small
- Share your analysis with the group
- Discuss to reconcile the different analyses to agree on one analysis that decomposes the project in a way that accounts for all of the different analyses

2.
- List all of the contributors to the project -- no matter what they did (may need input from project contributors themselves since not everything is tracked). Just write down their names.
- Divide up and assign the contributors evenly among the participants
- For each contributor assigned to you, write down everything that they contributed to (get input from project contributors if needed). But write it in the passive voice as "X was done" instead of "A did X," and without mentioning the name of the contributor. X should be as general as possible, but specific enough that one of these is true: (a) only one person worked on it or (b) it cannot be known more specifically (e.g. if three people worked on something together. Even in this case, just say "X was done").
- When everyone is done, everyone passes the anonymized actions list to the next person.
- Now everyone takes turns reciting actions in the list they hold one by one and these are added to a shared board.

3.
- Individually (not as a group) link each action to the most specific components (one or more) you can find
- You should never need to link an action to two different component hierarchy levels on the same branch. If you feel you want to, then go ahead and do it, and bring this up to the group in the next step.
- When everyone is done, share your assessment with the group
- Discuss to reconcile and agree on the links between actions and components on the shared board

4.
- Individually (not as a group) appraise the proportion of value of each component contributed by each action (the total on all of the action-edges leading into a component must equal 100%)
- When everyone is done, share your appraisal with the group
- Discuss to reconcile and agree on the proportions of value contributed by actions to each component

5. Follow a similar process to "list actions" to list all _material_ / capital (anonymized to purpose) used in the project
- write down a suitable name for each instance of material used
- ...
- Discuss to reconcile and agree on the links between material and components on the shared board
- Discuss to reconcile and agree on the proportions of value contributed by material to each component

6. Follow a similar process to "list actions" to list all _antecedent ideas_ (anonymized to purpose) used in the project
- write down a suitable name for each antecedent idea
- ...
- Discuss to reconcile and agree on the links between antecedent ideas and components on the shared board
- Discuss to reconcile and agree on the proportions of value contributed by ideas to each component

7. "Deanonymize" - probably becomes trivial if organizer is doing it
- Together, consult the original list of contributors and add each of them to the shared board
- Link each action to a _single_ contributor. If some actions were done by more than one person concurrently, create a single composite representing them

8. Repeat (7) for the original list of material, linking each instance of material to a source

9. Repeat (7) for the original list of ideas, linking each idea to an antecedent

10. Individually (or have at least two people) sum up the proportions by contributor to arrive at the final attributive proportions by contributor, capital source, and antecedent idea
