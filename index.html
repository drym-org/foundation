This comes from projects downstream in the ABE ecosystem that include the present project in their attributions (e.g. either using it as capital or exhibiting ideas present in the present project).</p></li></ol><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Perspectives)"></a>Perspectives</h3><h4>2.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Users)"></a>Users</h4><ol><li><p>Users of the product or service may pay any amount to use it, including nothing. Thus, unlike the typical sense of the word "price," payment of the agreed-upon price here is not a precondition for use of the product or service. Instead, the price is simply a measure of the value provided by the service and it is used in accounting, as will be explained below.</p></li></ol><h4>2.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Contributors)"></a>Contributors</h4><ol><li><p>There are many kinds of contribution that someone might make to the project. Any contribution is understood as either being a labor, capital, or idea contribution. In addition, there are also purely financial contributions, i.e. someone simply paying money to the project. In traditional finance, money is treated as capital, but here we differentiate these since capital contributions in the ABE sense typically serve a bounded and describable (and thus appraisable) purpose within the project, whereas money is generally treated as applying to the whole project. For instance, in a carpentry business, nails of a particular kind would be treated as capital, but if those nails aren&rsquo;t used in any finished products, then they are considered to contribute no value. On the other hand, money typically cannot be subdivided as being used for specific purposes, as units of money are interchangeable (there is no "this money" and "that money" except if such bounds are artificially set), and for the purposes of ABE accounting, all money paid to projects is essentially treated as going into a common well, with all sources being proportionately recognized. We say that money represents <span class="emph">anonymous</span> value, whereas labor, capital, and ideas represent appraisable, non-anonymous value. From the perspective of would-be contributors, financial contributions represent the least risk, as such contributions grow at the rate of the project as a whole. Non-financial contributions are directly appraised in terms of value contributed to the project (as will be explained below), so they may grow at a higher or lower rate.</p></li></ol><h4>2.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Accountants)"></a>Accountants</h4><ol><li><p>All accounting for a project is public information. Every payment made into and out of a project is publicly declared, even if it is anonymized. Attributions are publicly declared, even if anonymized. Price and valuation are publicly declared as well.</p></li><li><p>Financial contributions to the project are immediately distributed to all project contributors according to the current attributions.</p></li><li><p>Financial contributions to a project are treated in a two-pronged way in consideration of the magnitude of such contributions relative to the fair market price:</p></li><li><p>If the contribution is less than or equal to the price, then it is treated simply as compensation for use of the project, and nothing further needs to be done.</p></li><li><p>If the contribution exceeds the price, then the excess is treated as an <span class="emph">investment</span>, entitling the contributor to an attributive share of revenues determined in relation to the present valuation.</p></li><li><p>In the case of such investments, in addition to being paid out according to the a priori attributions, the fresh investment also increases the valuation of the project by the investment amount, and entitles the investor a share of revenues of the new valuation according to the size of their investment in relation to that new valuation. In other words, an investment simultaneously pays out existing contributors, dilutes attributions, and increases valuation. For instance, if a project is worth $100 and there is a $100 investment, then existing contributors get the $100, the new valuation is $200 and the investor now has a 50% attributive share.</p></li><li><p>Fresh non-financial contributions also increase the valuation of the project, but they do so via DIA appraisal of their attributive share. That is, once the value of the contribution is appraised in relation to the whole project, a new valuation is implied by considering the existing valuation and the incoming proportion of value represented by the fresh contribution. Essentially, non-financial contributions increase valuation in an inverse way to how investments do it &ndash; in the case of investments, it is the valuation that is known, and the attribution is determined from it, whereas here it is the other way around.</p></li><li><p>Due to the potentially large number of investors in ABE projects and as the investment level might typically be small, the project may internally redistribute money owed to investors (according to current attributions) until such a time as the amount owed exceeds a minimum threshold (e.g. $1 or $5), to avoid a large number of insignificant micropayments incurring comparatively large transactional overhead. These owed amounts remain, however, and until they are paid out, the aggregate outstanding amount is treated as debt in relation to the project.</p></li><li><p>Subtleties of equity and debt. As in traditional finance, there are two ways in which money available to a project may be treated, which are analogous to the traditional concepts of equity and debt. Equity in the ABE sense translates tangibly to shares of revenue (as determined by attributive stake) rather than an abstract idea of ownership. A project may also record some amount as debt. When debt exists, revenues must first pay out such debts before paying anyone with attributive stake. So far it seems fairly similar to traditional debt financing. Where it differs is in the role it plays and in its mechanics. First, debt presupposes equity. That is, debt may only be owed to those who have attributive stake but are unable to collect the money for some reason. Debt is not an alternative to attributive stake nor is it a substitute for payment for use. The reason is that the use of debt in this manner would compromise the accuracy of the system in assessing sources of value and consequent level of empowerment, since equity in ABE is a direct measure of value generated unlike in traditional markets where it is only an indirect and partial measure. As far as mechanics, the debt is carried by the project rather than by any contributor, and will always only be paid out from fresh revenues. Contributors are never directly liable for the project&rsquo;s debt &ndash; they simply stop receiving income at such a time as the debt becomes payable, until the debt is fully paid out (but they are still accountable to the system as their effective debt is translated into an investment or tax &ndash; see "insurance and taxes"). In the event the debt isn&rsquo;t currently payable, then revenues will be distributed according to attributive stake as usual. If there is more than one debt, then they are paid out by treating the magnitude of each as representing its "attributive stake" in fresh revenues, so that all debts are paid off at the same relative rate. Since unpaid debt represents uncompensated value, in the event a project stops generating revenue and a debt goes unpaid, it is in the interests of all for the system to bear the cost and fulfill the unpaid debt, using the same systemic "insurance" described elsewhere in this document.</p></li><li><p>Backpropagation. DIA is informed by the precedents implicit in every other instance of conducting DIA. In each case when such a precedent is being considered for application, additional nuances or even mistaken assumptions in past application may become apparent. In such cases, the precedent in its fresh application is considered to be revised or elaborated in relation to the original, and all previous cases where the precedent was applied are subject to revision in this light. The precise accounting of backpropagation is as follows. Those who have been underpaid in the past in light of the revision will have debt recorded by the project in their favor. This would implicitly ensure that they would be paid their balance before other project contributors receive attributive income and also preclude the need to have any special handling for contributors who have been overpaid (see "Debt"). The tricky part is in computing the amount owed and the correct attributions. This is done by (1) applying the new precedent on the original attributions to get the adjusted original attributions, (2) noting project revenues by period delimited by attribution dilution events, (3) recomputing dilution in each such event using the corrected input attributions to arrive at a series of corresponding pairs of attributions and revenues. (4) With this series, the contributor&rsquo;s share of revenues for each period may be computed, the total of which gives us the final debt amount. The project&rsquo;s current attributions should be updated to reflect the final attributions produced in this series, and this will be in effect going forward. Aside from recording debt and updating the current attributions, nothing further needs to be done.</p></li><li><p>Renormalization. When there is a fresh contribution made to a project, naively, DIA would need to be undertaken afresh in order to incorporate the new contribution and dilute prior attributions. Renormalization is a way to compute dilution of attributions by comparing the new contribution to existing ones ("proxies"), which avoids the need to reassign any prior attribution share and localizes the scope of DIA to the specific new contribution. As an example, say there is an existing contribution that is valued at 20% (with attributions totaling to 100%) that the fresh one is analogous to. Then on that basis if we conclude that the fresh one is some proportion of value with respect to that one, of equal value, say, then we could assign it a value of 20, as well. This results in a new provisional total of 100 + 20 = 120 for the attributions. We then scale all shares down ("renormalize" them) by 100/120 so they total 100 once again, giving us the diluted posterior attributions. Renormalization may be done in this way at the accounting stage on attributions already determined, but it is also a tool available to analysts during the appraisal stage of DIA that may be used in coming up with the attributions to begin with.</p></li></ol><h4>2.4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Investors)"></a>Investors</h4><ol><li><p>Anyone may invest any amount in an ABE project.</p></li><li><p>In the initial stages of ABE, as there is no way to track use, and as we are employing the heuristic of the fair market price boundary to account investments vs compensation, we always treat payments up to the price as compensation, even if the payer isn&rsquo;t a user of the project. In the future, if we are able to track use (using transparent, open source, publicly managed methods), then we may be able to distinguish pure investments by non-users. Until then, everyone is treated as a user. In practice, as the price is usually low compared with valuation, it may not make a big difference to investors.</p></li><li><p>In many respects, ABE is a combination of the startup investment model (investors gain attributive stake and there is dilution) and the model of trading on public markets (investors immediately receive shares of revenue or dividend). The result is that anyone may participate in investment at any stage of the project (like public markets), and not only those who are wealthy (as is the case for startup investment), and everyone gets an attributive stake proportionate to their investment (as in the startup model). ABE is more flexible than the startup model, however, since ownership stake in the latter is pre-determined ("You get 30% and I get 70%") and based either on the limited value already created or on speculation about future value not yet created (or even based on incidental factors like who is a more skilled negotiator or marketer!). In ABE, it is a dynamic function of actual value (of any kind &ndash; labor, capital, ideas, or money) contributed over time, as assessed by a transparent and fair process (DIA).</p></li></ol><h4>2.5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Analysts)"></a>Analysts</h4><ol><li><p>Non-financial contributions to a project are attributed a share of revenues by the process of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution (DIA). DIA is a collective process where groups of people ("analysts") appraise labor, capital, and idea contributions made to the project and agree on the proportionate value of each contribution to the project as a whole. The result of DIA is a set of <span class="emph">attributions</span> prescribing the proportions of payments made to the project that are owed to each contributor, determined as the sum of proportions of all contributions made to the project by them. That is, contributors to the project receive shares of revenue of the project commensurate with the value provided by them, as agreed upon in a collective process that anyone may participate in. The process of DIA is guided by data, standards, conventions, heuristics, precedents, and other guidelines specified in the ABE founding documents that are designed to produce fair and accurate results and also improve the process itself over time. The process in its methodology resembles a combination of the traditional fields of financial analysis, data science, legal practice and political deliberation. The rationale and conclusions of DIA in relation to a project are publicly recorded and open to revision.</p></li><li><p>Labor, capital and ideas. Non-financial contributions to the project are understood as being either labor, capital or ideas. Labor is work done specifically for the project rather than reused, and as such, it may include ideas and capital that meets this requirement. Capital is anything that is <span class="emph">materially</span> present in the project while it is in use, and which isn&rsquo;t accounted as labor. For software projects, this could include third party libraries and APIs used. Capital does <span class="emph">not</span> include "instruments" used in labor done for the project, as that is accounted under "use" of projects, that is to say, for now, these tools should be paid for by the project contributors using them. In the future if price is eliminated in favor of specific value assessment (see "Price"), instruments used may warrant a separate category than the other three here, and DIA procedures for appraising them would need to be defined. Ideas includes any ideas that are exhibited by the project that aren&rsquo;t accounted as labor. In the process of DIA, antecedent projects exhibiting these ideas will be identified and accorded an attributive stake on this basis &ndash; the basis here is purely similarity and temporal precedence, <span class="emph">not causation</span>. This is both because this kind of causation is essentially impossible to model with currently available science and also because causation is considered less relevant (if at all) than the goal of empowering value creation. Temporal precedence is also defined loosely and in service of this broader goal, so that for instance, projects that appear within one year of each other may be considered cotemporal or "cognates" from the perspective of ideas, mutually according attributive stake in revenues. DIA analysts have full discretion in making these determinations, and their conclusions, as always, form precedents for future application and scrutiny (and possible retroactive revision via "backpropagation," i.e. the application of future standards to correct past assessments).</p></li><li><p>Double counting. The same contribution may count as labor on more than one project, reflecting the distinct value that it contributes to each project. But the same work should not count for the same value provided more than once. For example, say a user requests a particular feature in an application. The developers of that application determine that the best way to support the feature is for a capital dependency to be extended in some way. The developers of the dependency contribute this addition in order to satisfy the needs of the application, and they also provide general support as the application developers incorporate the new functionality. As this feature was added in service of the application, it counts as labor for the application in terms of the specific value provided by the feature to the application. But it also counts as labor for the dependency as a general facility that is available to other projects using the dependency. Additionally, the suggestion by the application to add the feature counts as labor for the dependency, and the suggestion by the user counts as labor for the application. The same work counts twice in all of these cases, yet, it counts in terms of specific relevance to each project. On the other hand, the generic support provided by the dependency developers counts only as labor for the dependency. Of course, if this support results in other, specific, improvements in the application, then those specific improvements would count as labor on the latter.</p></li><li><p>Valuation of the project is in principle a function of revenue, for instance, the Net Present Value (NPV) of the aggregate of the three revenue streams over the useful lifetime of the project. In the early stages of ABE, since there is very little or no revenue, and also high uncertainty regarding the potential magnitude of these revenue streams, other data and heuristics are used to estimate valuation, such as estimates of the industry cost of producing the project. The valuation is agreed upon in a collective and transparent process that anyone may participate in, with the rationale publicly recorded and the conclusions open to revision.</p></li><li><p>Price. The amount payable to the project for use is in principle determined as the share of value created using the project in each <span class="emph">specific</span> case, a share that is once again determined through DIA, and discounted by some factor to preserve the optimal incentives (see Incentive Structures for more on this). But as this information is unlikely to be available in practice (e.g. it may be private information, and the technological means to track use are currently unavailable), we employ the heuristic of a fair market price as a measure of <span class="emph">generic</span> value provided. At least in the early stages of ABE, this price is typically set by proxy analysis, that is, by looking at the prices of similar or analogous projects that have a market price in traditional markets. The price is agreed upon in a collective and transparent process that anyone may participate in, with the rationale publicly recorded and the conclusions open to revision.</p></li></ol><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Incentive_.Structures)"></a>Incentive Structures</h3><ol><li><p>There are no constraints on contributors on the use of the money paid to them by the project. Yet, the project generating tangible returns for them is a measure of the confidence of the community in the value of the project. Thus, it is also an inverse measure of the risk level of future contributions to the project. Each payment thus constitutes an incentive for future contribution.</p></li><li><p>As payments made to contributors is public information, such payments equally serve as incentives for future contribution for <span class="emph">all</span> people, and not only the contributors being paid this time.</p></li><li><p>In traditional markets there is a dichotomy known as primary vs secondary investments. Primary is where projects sell "ownership" stake in exchange for money that will be used for future contributions. Such future contributions are guided by a bureaucracy that employs people who in many cases are the original creators of the value already generated by the project. The bureaucracy pays such contributors a steady income, representing a low risk environment for such contributors, but also one where they don&rsquo;t directly reap the benefits of valuable contributions (or the cost of non-valuable ones) made by them. The secondary market is where shares of ownership are sold for money. Traders gain or lose in terms of the <span class="emph">valuation</span> of the project, while also receiving shares of revenue (dividend) while they retain ownership. The traders themselves are not involved in the project&rsquo;s value creation, and from the project&rsquo;s perspective, serve the role of determining market price of each share (not of the service provided) and consequently valuation of the project as a whole.</p></li><li><p>ABE unifies the primary and secondary investment model. In ABE, as payments to projects immediately pay out to all contributors, it is like secondary investments in this respect. In secondary investments, the dividends paid to shareholders are typically discounted, with some portion set aside by the board of directors for reinvestment in future initiatives. In ABE, dividends are paid in full rather than discounted. Thus, one difference from secondary markets is that the dividend amount is higher in ABE, likely much higher, since there is no management overhead, and the logistical overhead (e.g. compensating DIA analysts) is common to the entire ecosystem and thus efficient and market-guided. The reliance on dividends makes the model seem more similar to secondary investments, yet, unlike the secondary market, the people being paid out are not random people, but rather, the <span class="emph">value contributors themselves</span>. This puts those most familiar with value creation in a position to create more value, and in this respect it is more like primary investments. Finally, unlike both primary and secondary markets, there is no provision in ABE for trading away attributive stake (see "liquidity" below).</p></li><li><p>In ABE, since project contributors have been paid, they are themselves in a position to spend the money on future initiatives for the project. As they are the ones who have already been publicly and fairly recognized as contributing the most value to the project, they are adjudged to be in the best position to assess future value. This is in contrast to traditional primary market-funded bureaucracies, where there is no such "proof" of the soundness of judgement of value by project management, and it is only an indirect proof since the primary value creators are obscured and are not systemically known as they are in ABE. The effective internal attribution levels within a corporation (e.g. salaries, authority) are not guaranteed to be fair as they are in ABE (via the process of DIA). Thus, this also implies that the incentives to create value are stronger in ABE since there is the promise of full and fair recognition. Low-risk income may still be drawn but by fulfilling well-specified labor items identified by those already accredited by the system, rather than by submitting to a bureaucracy.</p></li><li><p>ABE eliminates the boundary between the free market and corporate bureaucracy. Currently, companies use task management systems where tasks are prioritized and someone is made to work on them. There is limited flexibility on collaboration and efficient use of resources as these are essentially guided by decree (of the management hierarchy) rather than in a fluid market economy where the highest-value items are evident and also entail the highest reward, and where there are strong incentives to collaborate to efficiently leverage resources to do the task quickly. This efficiency, fair recognition, and encouragement of collaboration are features unique to ABE and not present in either corporate bureaucracies or in the capitalist market economy, and additionally, ABE eliminates this boundary by using the same attribution-based market paradigm in all cases, thus significantly minimizing the scope of bureaucratic activity, to a small enough scale where simple human interactions between friends are all that&rsquo;s needed, with formal attribution processes taking over at larger scales.</p></li><li><p>Payments to a project are immediately distributed according to current attributions, as mentioned earlier, but this is only always true for labor contributors. For capital and idea contributors, the money is only paid to them if they have put ABE in place on the concerned projects. This serves two purposes. First, it ensures that the payment made to them is likewise distributed fairly upstream, and secondly, it creates a financial incentive for ABE adoption. If the money isn&rsquo;t immediately payable, then it is redistributed in the present project according to the current attributions, but the owed amount remains unaffected, and represents debt that will be paid upon ABE adoption by the upstream project.</p></li><li><p>Incentives for early-stage investors. For this most part, the incentives here remain to be quantified. There are some promising signs as well as some indicators that things will be quite different under ABE, and that that may be a good thing. On the face of it, if the project is at an early stage of development and it is apparent that there is much value still to be reaped, then there is an incentive for investors to fund the project, since the value of money at an early stage of the project is likely to be higher than its value at a later stage. There is less risk for such investors than in traditional markets, since in ABE the assessment of value is more grounded in empirical data and facts and not contingent on artificial and unnecessary game theoretic uncertainty inherent in competition. For instance, if the project exhibits ideas that are later reflected in other projects, that is simply a fact, and it inherently entails attributive revenue. There is limited subjectivity there, since the process is guaranteed to be fair by the "dialectical mirror" property, that is, that standards used apply to everyone and are typically applied to anonymized data, so analysts can only conduct the process fairly and thus will generally certify facts that appear evident to the investor. Value is not contingent on whether the "company" "wins" or "loses." There is simply the creation and flow of value, and the recognition of it by all. This translates into more tractability of ABE in comparison with traditional markets, and consequently less risk. That could mean that investments in general lead to less returns than they might in traditional markets. On the other hand, these lower returns on average are also balanced out by greater tractability of the system, meaning that for those who have deep insights into projects and see how they could be useful, that they may gain significantly by virtue of their insight and in a way that isn&rsquo;t tempered by accidental risk. Those who gain significantly would truly be worthy of higher empowerment on the basis of facilitating the creation of value (which may be treated as "objective" in the context of DIA due to the dialectical mirror property), not speculation regarding <span class="emph">perception</span> of value and reactions to perceived value.</p></li><li><p>Paying for use. As users may pay any amount for use of the project (including zero), what incentivizes payment at all? For the most part, this is an open problem. Initially, the incentive will likely come from education, that supporting ABE projects leads to ABE adoption and that means that these users themselves can then launch projects of their own and expect revenue without having to work at traditional companies where they can&rsquo;t do their most valuable work (since the absence of fair recognition processes (such as DIA) within the company creates an incentive to contribute the minimum value that achieves the goals articulated by the bureaucracy). In the longer term, payment from use may be part of a general usage-tracking (and open source, publicly managed) system where opting into this system automatically fulfills payments from revenues generated by use. But such technology is presently out of reach. For now, we need other ways of incentivizing payment for use, perhaps cultural ways like offering codes that allow people to display badges showing their support for ABE projects, similar to the "I voted!" stickers used at US polling booths during elections.</p></li><li><p>Managing risk. The freedom to take chances is necessary to creating the most value. This freedom often comes with risk, since many things judged to be wrong are indeed wrong, but a few things judged to be wrong are often the most valuable things of all. This is a necessary property of the most valuable endeavors, since the right things must appear wrong against a wrong backdrop, otherwise they couldn&rsquo;t be right! So, in the event that a project ends up having negative value, it seems necessary to protect contributors against unbounded negative impact. For this purpose, the system should provide "insurance" of some kind. We could say that contributors (including investors) could always sever their link to a project, and in that case, they no longer receive recognition for that project, whether positive or negative. This could be done in a couple of different ways, e.g. (a) investors are always liable for up to some fraction of total loss (e.g. 1/e), (b) investors are never liable for loss, and instead, the negative appraisal of value of the project simply serves as a precedent that guarantees that similar projects and initiatives in the future are unlikely to be valuable, thus constituting a negative incentive for such activities in the future. The second option seems more daring, but also, may well be sufficient and better and more natural. In either case, the cost of unpaid negative value is borne by the system. But the premise is that this cost leads to greater global value creation.</p></li><li><p>Eliminating liquidity. Especially with option (b) for risk management, there is likely no longer any need to trade away assets to manage risk. The ability to do so would lead to inaccurate assessment of value, and the purpose of the entire system is to determine whom to empower in order to create the most value for all. In the absence of a competitive market, the uncertainty around the assessed value of a project is representative purely of the uncertainty of the future consequences of the project that are as yet unknown. It does not entail artificially created and unnecessary game-theoretic uncertainties borne of competition. Being able to trade away an attributive stake is thus equivalent to making an arbitrary person accountable for your actions, since your attributive stake represents <span class="emph">what you did</span> and isn&rsquo;t an arbitrary measure rooted in the notion of ownership, which, we contend, is a poorly founded notion in the majority of cases in general, and in the case of company ownership in particular (ABE proposes attributive stake as sufficient to model the imagined purpose of ownership in this case).</p></li><li><p>Global value vs local value. Projects are vehicles for channeling money, but the orientation is around maximizing global value rather than maximizing the value generated by any particular initiative. Thus if a desired valuable outcome can be achieved more efficiently by using project A than B, then the greatest incentive will always be to improve project A in order to achieve it. This is in contrast to traditional competitive markets where both A and B will be stretched to achieve the goal, and B may even prevail over A by virtue of incidental factors such as who is better funded and who gains a tactical advantage in relation to whatever rules of the game may happen to be in effect. Even independently of any moral ideal such as "may the best person win," (entailing the possibility that the best may not win &ndash; indeed, the best may not even be playing the game!) and rationalizations such as "all&rsquo;s fair in love and war," this is a <span class="emph">wasteful</span> outcome. Structuring markets like wars is not only unnecessary but not a good solution either. In ABE, both projects A and B in practice have access to the same materials, and both projects may attribute one another as sources of value, even if project A is ultimately the one being used. Indeed, this quality means that the system over time will likely favor small atomic contributions that are composed to create projects, so that the difference between a project A and a project B is likely to be small as they would share the majority of components.</p></li><li><p>Motivation for distinct handling of labor, capital and ideas. A person has a finite amount of time to spend on projects. How they spend this time is guided by (but not determined by) incentives. The products of work in general have different reuse profiles &ndash; some are highly reusable, while others are not reusable. If a particular product is reusable and if it is reused N times, then the creator is recognized for that task N times. Thus, all other things being equal, the more reusable the product is, the greater the incentive to work on it. Yet, in practice, a significant fraction of work produces valuable results that are non-reusable. Naively, such tasks would become disincentivized in an attribution-based system. In order to counter this, we introduce a compensatory factor that discounts each contribution to a project by the extent of reusability it is judged to have in relation to this project. The categories of labor, capital, and ideas represent a natural partitioning of contributions along the axis of reusability, where, as a heuristic, we may assume that for every product one has directly contributed labor on, there are N products they&rsquo;ve worked on that are materially used in other projects, and N&#178; projects that exhibit ideas they&rsquo;ve contributed to. To model labor, capital, and ideas as being equally valuable on average, we therefore discount the attributive proportions as 1, 1/N, and 1/N&#178;, respectively. This preserves the incentive to make things reusable while also recognizing the value of non-reusable work. Of course, in practice, the importance of labor, capital, or ideas to a project may vary, and it is always up to the discretion of analysts whether to apply the 1-N-N&#178; rule, and as always, their choice (including its rationale) represents a precedent that will inform future congresses.</p></li><li><p>Insurance and Taxes. There are many statistical anomalies and risks involved in the creation of value. These should be globally addressed in order to preserve local incentives while eliminating the conditions for local friction (e.g. treating unpaid debts as payable by the system rather than by local beneficiaries), and the system maintains an insurance policy to bear the costs in such cases (by paying the project an amount equal to the deficit, which goes fully towards debt by virtue of how debt works). Yet, the purpose of the system is to fairly recognize value. In some sense, patching local losses at a global level implies that these local enterprises are then overvalued. Therefore, in order to restore accuracy, an attributive stake in the revenues of these individuals is assigned to the system. This attributive stake is determined in the same way as for investments &ndash; that is, as the proportion of total valuation of the enterprise that the debt amount represents. At this stage, the individual&rsquo;s debt has been transformed into an investment in them by the system. On the face of it, this seems to indicate that the system inherently takes on all of the bad investments. But under the assumption (guiding the institution of the insurance policy) that these various unpaid debts are typically the result of statistical anomalies and random risk, it is likely that, in the aggregate, these investments will yield positive returns. Even so, as it stands, there is the risk that the system inherits a resonance with the interests of these "bad actors" by virtue of its increasing investment in them. Additionally, there is the matter of how the insurance policy is funded to begin with. The resolution to both of these issues is the same &ndash; the system must institute a tax on all beneficiaries. In order for the interests of the system to be in harmony with value, the tax must be a standard attributive share in all revenues generated in the system, that is, the system invests in all participants to an equal proportionate extent (e.g. 10%), essentially an income tax. Yet, the purpose of the tax is narrowly bounded to remaining solvent as an insurance policy for unpaid debts &ndash; nothing more. For the kind of investment in collective enterprises that traditional systems undertake, individuals and groups may already band together at arbitrary scales to share ideas and collaborate in any way and receive investment commensurate with perceived value. Thus there is no need for the system to undertake such activities, as there is in traditional economic and government systems.</p></li></ol></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
