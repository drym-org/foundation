**This document is to be considered a DRAFT until it is formally ratified.**

We seek to put in place a new economic system achieving the goals of fair recognition of value and fair empowerment, efficiency in the use of resources both tangible and intangle, and alignment of interests at every level of social interaction, in order to achieve a stable, scalable, creative, peaceful, and kind world.

Toward these aims, we agree to employ the conventions described herein.

1. Members of the public (which may include project contributors) will engage in the process of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution to appraise the project, following any procedures that are deemed appropriate and fair that meet the twin goals of backward-looking fairness and forward-looking empowerment.

2. The goal of DIA is to produce a file ATTRIBUTIONS.txt representing the proportions of aggregate historical value in the repository contributed by each person. These proportions must total to 100%. Alongside this, the process should also produce a file ATTRIBUTIONS-RATIONALE.txt that contains a log of the rationale and procedures followed, including referenced clauses in the founding documents where possible. This allows the possibility of revision in case of errors or in the interests of "backpropagation" of future standards (elaborated in the attribution model).

3. In addition, DIA must produce VALUATION.txt and PRICE.txt that contain the appraisal of total value in the project and a fair market price, respectively. These too should have accompanying VALUATION-RATIONALE.txt and PRICE-RATIONALE.txt files explaining the rationale and procedures followed and any referenced clauses in the founding documents.

6. The repo shall maintain an issue whereby reports of antecedents and other related work are solicited. These shall inform the process of DIA.

7. Repository maintainers are responsible for recording all payments made to the project in a payments folder, within 3 days of the payment being received.

8. Those who contribute to a project should ensure that their payment is reflected in the payments folder and could submit the necessary change for consideration, themselves. If the payment does not appear there in the allotted time, they should create an issue tagged "unrecorded payment," and repository maintainers have one week to resolve it. If it is unresolved in this time, the project will be considered to be "in default."

8B. Payments to projects must be recorded in the order they are received so that they are accounted using the correct current values of attributions, valuation and price. In order to ensure this, a single person shall be put in charge of recording payments.

9. Projects that are in default are no longer eligible to receive payments from other ABE projects until the issues are resolved.

10A. Upstream projects are only eligible to receive payments owed to them once they adopt ABE, upon completion of DIA.

10B. Payments held on behalf of upstream projects shall be fairly reinvested in the current project -- that is, according to the present attributions -- until the upstream share reaches zero.

11. Payments owed to upstream projects are immutable in the sense that they are considered to be facts. If a project cannot be paid for any reason, the balance owed to them will be reinvested, but the project's entitlement remains unaffected and is eligible to be fulfilled by the system at a future date as soon as it becomes possible to do so.

12. Projects in default may be negatively attributed, so that some portion of the payments owed to them will be fairly reinvested.

13. Maintainers must record all payments made to contributors in a payouts folder, within 7 days of making the payment, to ensure that reported balances are kept current.

14. Work done towards attribution shall be entitled to 5% of the value of the project, incentivizing participation in fairly and comprehensively identifying and recognizing antecedents.

15. When voluntary payments are made to the project, contributors should be paid their full outstanding balance biweekly (i.e. every other week) on a designated day of the week. If these payments have not been initiated within 3 days of the designated day, the project will be considered to be in default.

16. This constitution and other founding documents may be amended through a collective process subject to agreement.

17. A congress to conduct DIA must be solicited for a project following ABE within 30 days of its receiving its first payment, and must be completed within one quarter (three months). This may be a congress organized specifically for the project, or it may be a congress already planned for which the project may be added to the docket. The results of this initial congress apply to any payments already received by the project up to that point, in addition to subsequent payments.

18. There must be at least three people present at a DIA congress.

19. For each project on the docket at a DIA congress, if less than a third of attendees present are unaffiliated with it, then that project is ineligible to be considered. At least one person affiliated with the project must be present or, if none will be present, the project members must endorse consideration of their project at the congress.

20. Any gathering that meets these requirements for a congress may be considered a congress and may conduct official deliberations upon invoking this constitution.

21. If there are prior resolutions that anyone believes need to be reviewed, they should submit their notes for inclusion in the docket entry for that project at the next congress.

22. For any prior resolution identified for review in advance of the congress, an effort should be made to invite the participants to that resolution to attend the congress. Their participation is not mandatory.

23. The conclusions of the most recent congress take precedence over all previous congresses, and any revisions of previous resolutions (as opposed to fresh resolutions) "backpropagate" as described in the attribution model.

24. A project must be appraised at an ABE congress at least once a quarter. In the interim, nontrivial contributions to the project should be accompanied by relative appraisal and renormalization to arrive at a provisional appraisal. These should be honored until DIA is conducted.

25. The docket for a congress must be finalized at least two weeks in advance of the congress, to leave sufficient time for attendees to learn about the projects being appraised and come prepared. Notes on docket items, along with any other supporting materials, may continue to be added until the congress is held.
