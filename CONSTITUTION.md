We seek to put in place a new economic system achieving the goals of fair recognition of value and fair empowerment, efficiency in the use of resources both tangible and intangle, and alignment of interests at every level of social interaction, in order to achieve a stable, scalable, creative, peaceful, and kind world.

Toward these aims, we agree to employ the conventions described herein.

1. Members of the public (which may include project contributors) will engage in the process of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution to appraise the project, following any procedures that are deemed appropriate and fair that meet the twin goals of backward-looking fairness and forward-looking empowerment.

2. The goal of DIA is to produce a file ATTRIBUTIONS.txt representing the proportions of aggregate historical value in the repository contributed by each person. These proportions must total to 100%.

3. In addition, DIA must produce VALUATION.txt and PRICE.txt that contain the appraisal of total value in the project and a fair market price, respectively.

4. A file attribution/CONTRIBUTORS.md shall be maintained, to contain anyone who has made any kind of direct contribution to the project.

5. A file attribution/RELATED_WORK.md shall be maintained, to contain any work that appears related to the present work, whether that is by virtue of exhibiting similar ideas or having a similar purpose, or any other connection discernible.

6. The repo shall maintain an issue whereby reports of antecedents and other related work are solicited. These will be added to RELATED_WORK.

7. Repository maintainers are responsible for recording all payments made to the project in a payments folder, within 3 days of the payment being received.

8. Those who contribute to a project should ensure that their payment is reflected in the payments folder and could submit the necessary change for consideration, themselves. If the payment does not appear there in the allotted time, they should create an issue tagged "unrecorded payment," and repository maintainers have one week to resolve it. If it is unresolved in this time, the project will be considered to be "in default."

9. Projects that are in default are no longer eligible to receive payments from other ABE projects until the issues are resolved.

10. Payments held on behalf of upstream projects shall be fairly reinvested in the system -- that is, according to the present proportions of aggregate value represented by all of the projects in the system.

11. Payments owed to upstream projects are immutable in the sense that they are considered to be facts. If these projects do not claim them for whatever reason, they will be reinvested, but the project's entitlement remains unaffected, and is eligible to be fulfilled by the system at a future date as soon as it becomes possible to do so.

12. Projects in default may be negatively attributed, so that some portion of the payments owed to them will be fairly reinvested.

13. Maintainers must record all payments made to contributors in a payouts folder, within 7 days of making the payment, to ensure that reported balances are kept current.

14. Work done towards attribution shall be entitled to 5% of the value of the project, incentivizing participation in fairly and comprehensively identifying and recognizing antecedents.

15. When voluntary payments are made to the project, contributors should be paid their share of contributions within 3 days.

16. This constitution and other founding documents may be amended through a collective process subject to agreement.
