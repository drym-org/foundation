This document describes the financial model employed in Attribution-Based Economics.

1. Payments made to the project are immediately distributed to contributors in accordance with the agreed-upon and current proportions in the ATTRIBUTIONS file.

2. As part of the process of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution (DIA), a PRICE and a VALUATION should be agreed upon.

3. The price, or fair market price, represents the amount of money that use of a project is worth, expressed as a one-time amount. Payment of this price is in no way a precondition to use of the project (in contrast with typical senses of the word "price"). Rather, it serves an accounting purpose described below.

4. The valuation is an assessment of aggregate value in the project. Valuation is a function of (1) revenue from use and (2) revenue from attribution, and should be computed as a Net Present Value (NPV) of the projection of revenues from these sources.

5. Revenue from use Rᵤ comprises payments made by those using the project. It can be projected from (1) the fair market price, (2) an estimate of total number of expected users, (3) an estimate of the proportion of those who would be paying users, (4) over the expected useful lifetime T of the project. Rᵤ could be expressed as a Gaussian function over T.

6. Revenue from attribution Rₐ comprises attributive revenue from downstream projects. It could be estimated using a logarithmically increasing function that reaches the peak of the Rᵤ curve at the end of the useful lifetime T.

7. Any payment made to the project will be considered in relation to the fair market price at the time of the payment. If the total payment by the payer up to that point is less than or equal to the fair market price, it will be treated as compensation. If the total payment exceeds the price, it will be treated as an "investment."

8. Investments increase the valuation by an equal amount and thus result in "dilution" of all attributions.

9. Investments are attributable in terms of the diluted valuation as a consequence of the payment. The proportion of the valuation represented by the investment component of the payment entitles the payer to that proportion of attributable value in the project, and this should be reflected in the ATTRIBUTIONS file _after_ the distributions have been paid out from the payment according to the a priori attribution proportions.
