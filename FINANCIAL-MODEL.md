This document describes the financial model employed in Attribution-Based Economics.

1. Payments made to the project are immediately distributed to contributors in accordance with the agreed-upon and current proportions in the ATTRIBUTIONS file.

2. As part of the process of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution (DIA), a VALUATION and a PRICE should be agreed upon. The valuation is an assessment of aggregate value in the project. The price is a fair market price for the use of the project.

3. Any payment made to the project will be considered in relation to the fair market price at the time of the payment. If the total payment by the payer up to that point is less than or equal to the fair market price, it will be treated as compensation. If the total payment exceeds the price, it will be treated as an "investment."

4. Investments in the sense of (2) are attributable in terms of the current valuation at the time of the payment. The proportion of the valuation represented by the investment component of the payment entitles the payer to that proportion of attributable value in the project, and this should be reflected in the ATTRIBUTIONS file _after_ the distributions have been paid out from the payment according to the a priori attribution proportions.
