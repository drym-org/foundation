This repository contains founding documents for Attribution-Based Economics. These include:

1. The Constitution, which describes high level goals and practices to be followed.
2. The Attribution Model, which describes principles of Dialectical Inheritance Attribution.
3. The Financial Model, which describes the financial basis of the system and how payments and revenues are to be channeled.
4. The Declaration of Non-Ownership, which sheds the idea of ownership as it is an obstruction to fair value recognition in intangible works.

# Supporting this Project

Please make any financial contributions by Venmo to ``@Sid-K``.

This project follows Attribution-Based Economics as described in [drym-org/foundation](https://github.com/drym-org/foundation). Any financial contributions will be distributed to contributors and antecedents as agreed-upon in a collective process that anyone may participate in. To see the current distributions, take a look at [abe/attributions.txt](https://github.com/drym-org/old-abe/blob/main/abe/attributions.txt). To see payments made into and out of the project, see the [abe](https://github.com/drym-org/old-abe/blob/main/abe/) folder.

Additionally, some portion of your voluntary payment could be treated as an investment, entitling you to a share in future revenues, including payments made in the future or attributive revenue from other projects.

NOTE: This project is now accepting voluntary payments, and will distribute them according to ABE guidelines starting on Jan 1, 2023, to leave enough time to come up with attribution proportions and other community appraisal.
